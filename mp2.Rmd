```{r, include=FALSE}
#loading the data
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

ideas for what to display
- spending by state (which state's elections are most contributed to?)
- see if higher spending correlates with a win (relate spending, a specfic candidate, and win/lose)
- name and types/designations of the highest-contributing committees
